            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Dynamic and motivated, I'm Hai Huong Le Vu (She/Her), a multifaceted journalist, finance enthusiast, and third-year economics student at the University of Ottawa.</p><br>

            <p>As Vice-President of Financial Affairs for the Sociology and Anthropology Student Association (SASA), I adeptly manage funds and collaborate on budget planning. My previous tenure as Vice-President of Francophone Affairs and Bilingualism underscores my commitment to fostering community among bilingual students. At La Rotonde, I've honed my journalism skills, conducting high-level interviews and crafting impactful articles on topics spanning science diplomacy to eco-anxiety.</p><br>
                
            <p>My passion for interdisciplinary research led me to explore AI in education through collaborative workshops, fostering innovative discussions. Committed to making a difference, I've organized fundraisers for homeless youth, raising significant funds and donations.</p><br>
                
            <p>With proven leadership, teamwork, and effective communication skills, I eagerly anticipate leveraging my expertise in diverse and challenging environments. Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy developing my photography skills in my free time. Feel free to explore my work in the "Featured" section. Let's connect and collaborate on meaningful projects!</p>
